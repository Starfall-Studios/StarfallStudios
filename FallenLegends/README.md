# Fallen Legends

## The game
imaginary creatures (with their respective statistics of attack, defence, resistance, etc.), in which players will move to a certain area on a map of the real world, with an envelope of creatures and different items (such as materials or gems), and move to capture different creatures and conquer areas of other players, where they fight against an artificial intelligence (AI).
We have chosen to address this idea, as we found it a good opportunity to embrace different concepts from other mobile games, such as Pokemon GO, Clash Of Clans or Hearthstone.
