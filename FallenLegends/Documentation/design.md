# Design of Fallen Legends

## Android Version
We have chosen Android 8.0 as the minimum version for our game. This is because we want to reach the largest possible audience, and Android 8.0 is the version that is installed on the largest number of devices (90,7% of Android users has Android 8.0 or higer in their devices). 

## Java Version
We have chosen Java 8 to work in Android Studio.
